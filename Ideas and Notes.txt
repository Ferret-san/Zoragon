ERC-721 is the standard API for ownership of NFTs on Ethereum.

No native monetization to ERC-721, by late 2020 the Zora team realized that the
NFT market was fragmented into different platforms that Lock in creators/artists
by forcing exclusivity, platform fees, or platform specific royalties, which made
this platforms (Opensea, etc) predatory like other big tech platforms.

Zora is a protocol that makes the ERC-721 richer, or an extension of ERC-721 if you will.
Zora is not a marketplace or a platform.
